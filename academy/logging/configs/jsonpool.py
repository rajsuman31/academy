    This feature is aimed at mechanical processing of logs, rather than
    human readability.

    Logs written by this configuration are stored in JSON format under
    `logs/` in the Academy home directory resolved by
    [`get_academy_home()`][academy.home.get_academy_home].

    Under that directory, logs are first separated into directories by
    the (distributed) identity of the log configuration: logs configured
    by the same JSONPoolLogging object, or by a serialized/deserialized
    copy of the same object, will appear under the same directory.

    Within that directory, each instance of log initialization will get a
    new log file.

    This logger is not configurable: it is intended to capture full debug
    logs from the root, with selection of log records made during the
    mechanical analysis stage.
